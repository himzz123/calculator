<p> The Black Death, also known as the Pestilence and the Plague,was the most fatal pandemic recorded in human history, 
resulting in the deaths of up to 75-200 million people in Eurasia and North Africa, peaking in Europe from 1347 to 1351.
The Black Death is estimated to have killed 30% to 60% of Europe's population.
The Black Death probably originated in Central Asia or East Asia,from where it travelled along the Silk Road, reaching Crimea by 1347. 
From there, it was most likely carried by fleas living on the black rats that travelled on Genoese merchant ships, spreading throughout the Mediterranean Basin and reaching Africa, Western Asia, and the rest of Europe via Constantinople, Sicily, and the Italian Peninsula.
In total, the plague may have reduced the world population from an estimated 475 million to 350â€“375 million in the 14th century.
It took 200 years for Europe's population to recover to its previous level.
Outbreaks of the plague recurred until the early 20th century. </p>
